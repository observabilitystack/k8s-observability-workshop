# Generic workshop cluster setup

This repository holds resources to set up a general workshop 
cluster. Upon setup participants

* work on their own server in e.g. Hetzner or Digital Ocean cloud
* edit the workshop files on their laptop transparently via _SSH/VSCode_ (or directly on the server using _vim/emacs/joe_)
* install, configure and launch workshop related software

> The current setup is meant to be used in a Kubernetes Observability Workshop at W-JAX 2019. A more general approach will move to it's own GitHub repo.
