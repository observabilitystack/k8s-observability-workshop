# Observability Workshop 

These are the resources for the observability workshop provided by [Torsten](https://www.thiswayup.de) and [Nikolaus](https://www.nikolauswinter.de). This stuff is open source, feel free to play around with it and learn. If you want to dive deeper and learn about observability at first hand, check out our next appearances or contact us for individual bookings.

## Information for our participants

To make the most of our day together, please prepare yourself well by making your laptop ready to work and providing us with some information:

### Have a terminal ready

If you work on a Mac or Linux system, you should be fine without any more effort.

If you work on a Windows machine, please make sure to have an SSH client installed. We recommend that you use PuTTY: https://www.putty.org/

### Create an SSH Key

As we provide you with your own cloud-based Kubernetes infrastructure for the duration of the workshop, we have to make sure that only you and your fellow participants have access to it. 

Please create yourself an SSH key and send us the **public** key in time before the workshop. Make sure that the **private** key is stored safely on the machine you bring to the workshop, ready to be used when needed to connect to the cluster.

Need some help? Check the following links:

* https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen/ (english)

Once you have your public SSH key ready, please send it over to one of our email addresses (or both). See you on the road!

### Easy editing via SSH

For a smooth editing experience, please install an editor that enables you to edit the files directly on a remote host. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Remote-SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) extension.
