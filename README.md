# Observability Workshop 

These are the resources for the observability workshop provided by [Torsten](https://www.thiswayup.de) and [Nikolaus](https://www.nikolauswinter.de). This repo is free and open source, feel free to play around with it and learn. If you want to dive deeper and learn about observability at first hand, check out our next appearances or contact us for individual bookings:

## Information for our participants

Congrats! You booked a workshop with us! We are looking forward meeting you in person!
To make the most of our day together, __please prepare yourself__:

### 1) Have a terminal ready

* If you work on a _Mac_ or _Linux_ system, you should be fine without any more effort.
* If you work on a _Windows_ machine, please make sure to have an SSH client installed. We recommend that you use PuTTY: https://www.putty.org/

### 2) Join our Slack 

We use Slack to easily share stuff before and during our workshops. You're welcome to join, please use [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/o12stack/shared_invite/enQtODA0MzAzMjAwNzUyLTY1YTViZjVlZjY3ZjFkZTNlM2E1YWFiMTY4M2QwOTRhN2IyMjM3M2Q5MmYxMzUyMDk4ZGFkZmY1NzhlNmQ4ZDU).

### 3) Create an SSH Key

As we provide you with your own cloud-based Kubernetes infrastructure for the duration of the workshop, we have to make sure that only you and your fellow participants have access to it.

* [Create an SSH key](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.17/user/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) (or re-use an existing one)
* Send us the _public_ key in time before the workshop either via E-Mail to [Nikolaus](mailto:training@nikolauswinter.de) and/or [Torsten](mailto:tbk@thiswayup.de) or [Slack](https://o12stack.slack.com/). Make sure that the _private_ key is stored safely on the machine you bring to the workshop, ready to be used when needed to connect to the cluster.

### 4) Easy editing via SSH

For a smooth editing experience during the workshop, please install an editor that enables you to edit the files directly on a remote host. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Remote-SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) extension.
